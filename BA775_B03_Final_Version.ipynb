    "**Project title :** Global Pandemic And The Government - COVID-19’s Impact On Boston Government Employees’ Earnings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Definition:** Evaluate the Boston government sector to understand the impact of the global pandemic, COVID-19, on the employees’ earnings. \n",
    "The main topics that we will focus on covering are the followings: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine the data across years preceding, during, and following the pandemic to assess whether there have been any effects on both earnings and the workforce.\n",
    "2. Explore which job levels/positions have recorded the highest earnings, and which department have recorded the highest number of employees\n",
    "3. Determine which income component has the most impact on an employee’s gross earnings.\n",
    "4. Construct patterns from data collected across various Boston areas/zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** For the developement of this project we have used two datasets from two different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Boston Government - Office of Human Resources: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report\n",
    "  * The City of Boston releases an annual dataset containing payroll information for its employees, encompassing employee names, job details, and earnings breakdown, including base salary, overtime, and total compensation. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we are using the dataset spanning the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. This resource, offers citizens valuable insights into the financial aspects of the City's workforce during these specific years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. United States Zip Codes - Massachusetts: https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/ma/\n",
    "  * This dataset provides zip code information for Massachusetts, including key details such as zip code, type, primary city, state, county, timezone, latitude, longitude among others. It offers a concise and comprehensive snapshot of geographic and locational attributes associated with each zip code in the state of Massachusetts. By incorporating this dataset, the project can be analyzed in a location-wise level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation :** Government jobs tend to be secure because they are essential for the functioning of society and are less influenced by market fluctuations compared to private sector. We aim to provide insights into Boston’s government sector for our peers with potential interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executive Summary:** This project assesses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on earnings in the Boston government sector. Utilizing datasets from 2018 to 2022, sourced from Boston Government's payroll records and Massachusetts zip code information, the study evaluates changes in workforce and earnings during the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Key objectives include identifying top-earning job levels, determining departments with the highest employee numbers, and analyzing income components impacting gross earnings. Emphasis is placed on constructing patterns across Boston areas and zip codes. Motivated by the stability of government jobs, our project aims to provide insights into Boston's government workforce over the last five years, which can be a source of interest for our peers."

    "A higher median salary can indicate a department's commitment to competitive compensation, which can be essential for retaining talent. For example, the Boston Fire Department shows a median salary of USD 0.14 million, which is higher than that of the Boston Police Department at USD 0.11 million, despite the latter having a higher total earnings figure. This might suggest that the Fire Department has a more concentrated distribution of compensation towards the median, which could be interpreted as a more equitable pay structure."

    "Top Earnings Overview: Richard Beckers and Jacqueline M. McGowan of the Boston Police Department’s total earnings are significantly higher than their colleagues due to large 'other' payments, with both having no regular or overtime pay listed. This raises questions about the nature of these 'other' payments and whether they reflect bonus compensations, back pay, or other non-standard financial arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary Discrepancies: Donna M. Gavin, a Police Lieutenant, shows a balanced composition of pay with a modest regular pay and minimal overtime, indicating a structured compensation with less reliance on variable pay. In contrast, Shawn N. Harris, a Police Officer, has an exceptionally high regular pay and a large sum of overtime pay, highlighting disparities that may arise from different roles, special duties, or administrative errors that warrant further review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overtime: Overtime pay, seen in significant amounts for Harris and Williams, suggests these individuals are either extensively involved in operations requiring long hours or there may be systematic overtime budgeting issues within the department. The large variance in overtime pay among the top earners necessitates a deeper look into departmental staffing and workload distribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Answer**: Diverse Compensation Structures: The dataset showcases a range of total earnings, from Imani Monet Penn's USD 4,640 as an intern in the BPS Development to Leslie L Gant's USD 193,233.08 as a Principal at BPS Tynan Elementary. This variance indicates a broad spectrum of roles and the associated value placed on these positions within the public sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top Earners by Department: High-ranking roles, such as Jill E Carter as Assistant Superintendent and Kristen McCosh as Commissioner, command substantial earnings, at USD 168,470.83 and USD 119,961.5, respectively. These figures reflect the significant fiscal responsibility and leadership expectations associated with their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compensation and Job Titles: There's a notable correlation between job titles and earnings. Leadership positions such as elementary principals and commissioners are among the top earners, which aligns with the additional responsibilities and expertise required for these roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative Earnings Analysis: Comparing departments, we see a Commissioner in the Commission for Persons with Disabilities earning USD 119,961.5, whereas a Commissioner of Elderly Affairs earns USD 121,577.14, suggesting parity in pay for commissioners across different public service domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomalies and Outliers: The standout anomaly is the earnings for the 'Retirees' category, with Glenn L Brewington receiving only USD 3,020.72, a figure that dramatically deviates from the rest and could represent part-time work, a pension payout, or an administrative error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistencies in Pay: Marlene M Gibbs, a Teacher, earns USD 158,371.55, which is quite high relative to the common pay range for teachers. This could be due to additional duties, long tenure, or special qualifications warranting further examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiscal Oversight Implications: The data indicates a need for fiscal oversight to ensure that salaries are not only competitive but also justified based on the roles and responsibilities within each department.\n"

    "Our journey through the US economy from 2000 to 2020 unveiled some fascinating stories. One of the most striking tales was the dip during the 2008 recession, impacting both jobs and the overall economy. Although GDP and the number of businesses grew since 2000, job creation didn't keep up.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked closer at the recession years, we discovered that some job sectors remained stable, like Agriculture, Utilities, and Education, while others, such as Administrative, Manufacturing, and Construction, faced more ups and downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we traveled through states and their GDP, some states consistently stood out as leaders, like New York, California, and Texas. Florida, in particular, impressed us with its nearly doubled GDP over the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we explored how firm closures and GDP are connected. It turns out that when businesses struggled during the recession, it had a noticeable impact on the economy. The more firms closed, the lower the GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, our analysis illuminated the US economy's ups and downs, showcasing its resilience, differences between job sectors, and the tightrope walk between business health and economic prosperity. These insights provide us with valuable guidance as we navigate the complex world of economics.\n"
