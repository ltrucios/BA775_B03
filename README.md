**Project title :** Global Pandemic And The Government - COVID-19’s Impact On Boston Government Employees’ Earnings

**Problem Definition:** Evaluate the Boston government sector to understand the impact of the global pandemic, COVID-19, on the employees’ earnings. 
The main topics that we will focus on covering are the followings: 

1. Examine the data across years preceding, during, and following the pandemic to assess whether there have been any effects on both earnings and the workforce.
2. Explore which job levels/positions have recorded the highest earnings, and which department have recorded the highest number of employees
3. Determine which income component has the most impact on an employee’s gross earnings.
4. Construct patterns from data collected across various Boston areas/zip codes.

**Data:** For the developement of this project we have used two datasets from two different sources.

1. Boston Government - Office of Human Resources: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report
  * The City of Boston releases an annual dataset containing payroll information for its employees, encompassing employee names, job details, and earnings breakdown, including base salary, overtime, and total compensation. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we are using the dataset spanning the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. This resource, offers citizens valuable insights into the financial aspects of the City's workforce during these specific years.

2. United States Zip Codes - Massachusetts: https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/ma/
  * This dataset provides zip code information for Massachusetts, including key details such as zip code, type, primary city, state, county, timezone, latitude, longitude among others. It offers a concise and comprehensive snapshot of geographic and locational attributes associated with each zip code in the state of Massachusetts. By incorporating this dataset, the project can be analyzed in a location-wise level.


**Motivation :** Government jobs tend to be secure because they are essential for the functioning of society and are less influenced by market fluctuations compared to private sector. We aim to provide insights into Boston’s government sector for our peers with potential interest.

**Executive Summary:** This project assesses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on earnings in the Boston government sector. Utilizing datasets from 2018 to 2022, sourced from Boston Government's payroll records and Massachusetts zip code information, the study evaluates changes in workforce and earnings during the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Key objectives include identifying top-earning job levels, determining departments with the highest employee numbers, and analyzing income components impacting gross earnings. Emphasis is placed on constructing patterns across Boston areas and zip codes. Motivated by the stability of government jobs, our project aims to provide insights into Boston's government workforce over the last five years, which can be a source of interest for our peers.
